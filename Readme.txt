ADAPTIVE TRAFFIC CONTROL WITH DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
===========================================================================
Run file - run for 30 simulations to happen for each three methods (longest queue, static time , our approach)
and to run individually 
longest queue first - longest_seq_first.py
static time - static_time_control.py
our approach - traffic_light_control.py
and to see analysis run ananlysis.ipynb in jupyter notebook
